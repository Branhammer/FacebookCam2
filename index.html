<p>Featherweight Camera is an Android application that allows users to take pictures and quickly upload them to a facebook album. Once the app has uploaded an image it is deleted from the phone. The application preserves external storage for music and other files that are more important to store locally.</p>

<h3>Current Progress</h3>
<p>The app is functional. Users can take a bunch of pictures, login to Facebook, select an album and upload the photos there. They also have the option to move the photos to their local storage.</p>

<h3>Application Limitations</h3>
<p>The appication is far from perfect. Eventually I would like to include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Batch editing prior to upload</li>
  <li>Perhaps including Google or Dropbox support</li>
  <li>Adding descriptions to the photos being uploaded</li>
  <li>An interface overhaul, make it look nice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some Legal Stuff</h3>
<p>Featherweight Camera is not created by or developed by Facebook Inc. Featherweight's Facebook interaction is limited to features provided through the Facebook API. Any appearance of Facebook graphics and trademarks are accessed through thier developer resources.</p>
